THUNDERBIRD-INTEGRATION
 
This extension uses the GNOME Shell notifications system to inform the user
about new mail.     

INSTALLATION:

The install.sh script copies all files to the extension-folders of Thunderbird
and GNOME Shell. You can also do it yourself but don't forget to make 
gnome-shell-integration.py executable. You might need to restart Thunderbird 
with the -purgecaches flag.
