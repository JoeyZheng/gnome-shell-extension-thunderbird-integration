THUNDERBIRD-INTEGRATION

This extension consists of two components:
 
A Thunderbird addon which fires DBus-Signals when new mail arrives and when a 
message gets deleted or marked read.

A gnome-shell extension that connects to those signals and uses the gnome-shell
notification system to notify the user. On the first new mail a message tray 
icon will be created which collects consecutive notifications. Clicking on the 
notifications as they appear or within the summary of the message tray will 
activate Thunderbird. When a message gets deleted or marked read within 
Thunderbird it also gets removed from the summary. The last removed notification 
will also destroy the message tray icon.    

INSTALLATION:

The install.sh script copies all files to the extension-folders of the 
gnome-shell and Thunderbird. You can also do it yourself but don't forget to
make gnome-shell-integration.py executable. You might need to restart 
Thunderbird with the -purgecaches flag.
